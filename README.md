A helloworld app for voice notes; very simple but I use it a lot hehe

using NAudio:
 - Capture the PC audio output and write it to out.wav;
 - Capture the PC audio input and write it to in.wav;

Todo: what if audiodevice[0] is changed when recording

Todo: save the record correctly if PC is rebooted before recording is stopped
